# SafeSteer

## Background üèû
This application was inspired by a family friend of mine who is running a driving instructor business and wanted something to help with having a students information and schedule. This CRUD application was developed using RESTful architecture principles and MERN stack technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS. React v6.0, & Node.js)

## Application Details üìù
Upon starting the application, they will be in the login page of the site a user can login in if they have an account or click the `Sign up` navigation button to create an account.Once a user has logged in with, they will be brought to an index view of all the students in the Student's List table.


If you want to create a new student then you can click the `Create` button on the navigation bar. Once clicked you will be in a new page where you will be adding the first name, last name, address, date, cellphone, driversLicense, class, expires, email, dateOfBirth, and restrictions. After that you click on `Submit` button. You will then be redirected to the index view where your new student is.

Once a user has student/s in the table they can check the details about that student by clicking on the students first name. Also in the students details page you can see the details but also click the `PRINTABLE INFORMATION` button then a dialog will come up with all the information formated vertically. Also there is an `Update` button once clicked will be redirected to the update form where information of that student is preloaded into the input text boxes which a user can now change. Once the changes have been made the user then hits the `Update` button once again and be redirected back to the detials page for that student with the new updated infromation. If a user does not need to have that student in they can simply hit the `Delete` button on the details page and then be redirected to the index page with an updated table without that student. A user can simply hit the `Logout` button and be redirected to the login page.
